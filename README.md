# Schol_District_Analysis

## Project Overview
Analysis on school district performance using Jupyter Notebook with Python, Pandas Library and Numpy library.

The School Board would like to understand various performance metrics of the different school districts and schools.  You first work with Maria (our contact) provied the initial analysis based on data collected from many students and schools across districts.

While the School Board is pleased with the insight that we have provided in our work with Maria, it has been identified that there appears to be an anomalie in the data that has been in the math and reading scores of the grade nine students at Thomas High School. In order to ensure these results do not skew the analysis, the Boad has asked us to again work with Maria to remove the impact of these results by changing all the grade 9 Thomas High School math and reading scores to Nan (which is a null value).

The School Board will like to understand the impact of changing all the grade 9 math and reading scores at Thomas High School so we will now review how this change impacted various parts of the analysis relative to when it was ran including the scores that were removed.

## Analysis Results

### Impact on District Analysis
- The change of adding Nan to all grade 9 and Thomas High School math and reading scores did not have an impact on the district analysis.
